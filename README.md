TidyDataProject
===============

# for reading in the files, I am assuming all files are in your working directory

# read in the feature names and the activity labels

# read in the "test" data files, combine, and label "Subject_ID" and "Activity ID" columns

# read in the "train" data files, combine, and label "Subject_ID" and "Activity ID" columns

# merge the combined test and train data frames

# use labels file to add descriptive name for each activity based on "Activity_ID"

# use dplyr package functionality to tidy up the data

# keep only required columns

# order by subject id and activity id 

# remove activity id column as it is no longer needed

# rearrange the order of the columns

# group the data by activity and subject id

# summarize the data so each of the variable columns is collapsed to the mean

# read in descriptive variable names for features

# rename the columns in the data frame

# create a long tidy data frame based on organizing the data per variable per activity per subject

# write tidy data set to file

# use line below to read file back in to R
# test <- read.table("TidyDataSet.txt", header=TRUE)
